    Added a new hook to the :class:`.DefaultImpl`
    :meth:`.DefaultImpl.version_table_impl`.  This allows third party dialects
    to define the exact structure of the alembic_version table, to include use
    cases where the table requires special directives and/or additional columns
    so that it may function correctly on a particular backend.  This is not
    intended as a user-expansion hook, only a dialect implementation hook to
    produce a working alembic_version table. Pull request courtesy Maciek
    Bry≈Ñski.
