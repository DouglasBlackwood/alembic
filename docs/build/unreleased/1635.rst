    :tags: bug, autogenerate
    :tickets: 1635

    Fixed issue where the "modified_name" of :class:`.AlterColumnOp` would not
    be considered when rendering op directives for autogenerate. While
    autogenerate cannot detect changes in column name, this would nonetheless
    impact approaches that made use of this attribute in rewriter recipes. Pull
    request courtesy lenvk.
